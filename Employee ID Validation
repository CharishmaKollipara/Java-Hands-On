Global Info Technologies has approached you to develop an application to maintain the work details of their employees. 

Imagine you are developing the login module. In that module,you will have to validate the id with the format given from the client.

The format is "GBL/001/0417", here the first three letters are standard. 
Create a class UserMain and implement the functionalities which are required.



Sample Input 1:

Enter your ID

GBL/020/0715

Sample Output 1:

Login success




Sample Input 2:

Enter your ID

ABC/120/0215

Sample Output 2:

Incorrect ID


UserMain.java



import java.util.*;

public class UserMain {
                public static void main(String[] args) {

                                Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
                                System.out.println("Enter your ID");
                                String id;
                                id = s.next();
                                String regex = "[GBL/[0-9]{3}/[0-9]{4}$]*";
                                
                                if(id.matches(regex) == false | id.length()!=12)
                                {
                                                System.out.println("Incorrect ID");
                                }
                                else 
                                {
                                                System.out.println("Login success");
                                }
                }
}
