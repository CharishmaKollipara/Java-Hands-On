Question



Pass and Fail Count


Ram has passed in certain subjects and failed in a few. Write a program to count the no of subjects he passed in and the no of subjects he has failed in. Marks scored below 50 is considered as failed. If Ram has passed in all the subjects print "Ram passed in all subjects" and if failed print "Ram failed in all subjects".

Assume maximum size of array is 20,

Sample Input 1:
Enter the no of subjects:
6
60
70
80
90
45
49

Sample Output 1:

Ram passed in 4 subjects and failed in 2 subjects



Sample Input 2:
Enter the no of subjects:

0

Sample Output 2:

Invalid input range



Sample Input 3:
Enter the no of subjects:

-2

Sample Output 3:

Invalid input range




Count.java


import java.util.*;
public class Count {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int no_of_subjects,i,pass_count=0,fail_count=0;
		System.out.println("Enter the no of subjects:");
		no_of_subjects = sc.nextInt();
		int[] progress = new int[20];
		if(no_of_subjects <= 0)
			System.out.println("Invalid input range");
		else
		{
			for(i = 0;i < no_of_subjects;i++)
				progress[i] = sc.nextInt();
			for(i = 0;i < no_of_subjects;i++)
			{
				if(progress[i] < 50)
					fail_count++;
				else
					pass_count++;
			}
			if(pass_count == no_of_subjects)
				System.out.println("Ram passed in all subjects");
			else if(fail_count == no_of_subjects)
				System.out.println("Ram failed in all subjects");
			else
				System.out.println("Ram passed in " + pass_count + " subjects and failed in " + fail_count + " subjects");
		}
		
	}

}
