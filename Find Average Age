Question



Find Average Age


One of the least Insurance agencies recruited employees for their collection department. Now the HR needs a report as the average age of all the employees working in that department. Write a code to calculate the average age.

Implement a method "calculateAverage(int[] age)" to calculate the average age and return the result to the caller function. 

Note : 
Age limit should be minimum of 28 years and maximum of 40 years. 
Minimum of 2 employees is mandatory to calculate average age, if fails, the output should be "Please enter a valid employee count"
If any of the age is invalid, terminate the process and display "Invalid age encountered!"
Refer the sample given for read and display the output.

Sample Input 1:

Enter total no.of employees:

3

Enter the age for 3 employees:

30

31

32

Sample Output 1:

The average age is 31.00




Sample Input 2:

Enter total no.of employees:

2

Enter the age for 2 employees:

29

36

Sample Output 2:

The average age is 32.50




Sample Input 3:

Enter total no.of employees:

1

Sample Output 3:

Please enter a valid employee count
